Write a poem about a bear on a unicycle.

Consider the following facts:
- Bears typically do not ride bikes, unicycles even less so.
- Bears do live in the woods, but the woods seldom offer nice roads to travel on.
- A bear is quite heavy, most production unicycles are designed to carry humans, which in general are much lighter
- A bear is a top predator, with few natural enemies (humans excluded), they are therefore not terribly concerned with other animals opinons about them.
